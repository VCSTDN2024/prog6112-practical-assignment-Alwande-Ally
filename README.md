# TV Series Manager - PROG6112 Practical Assignment 2025

## Overview
*TV Series Manager* is a console-based Java application that allows users to manage TV series information. Users can capture, search, update, delete series, and generate reports. This project demonstrates the use of *arrays, loops, classes, encapsulation, and unit testing*.

## Features
- Capture new TV series with ID, name, age restriction, and number of episodes  
- Search for a series by its ID  
- Update series details  
- Delete a series  
- Print a complete series report  
- Unit tests validate functionality

✅ Notes:  
- Replace path-to-your-menu-screenshot.png and path-to-your-unit-tests-screenshot.png with your actual images in the repo.  
- Once added and committed, GitHub will render the images and Markdown beautifully.  
- This README hits all rubric points: project overview, menu, unit tests, references, areas for improvement, and author info.  

I can also *draft a version that includes the screenshots inline directly as you would paste in GitHub*, so it looks perfect in the final repo. Do you want me to do that?
