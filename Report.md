## Overview
The TV Series Manager is a simple console app written in Java that helps you organize TV series info. You can add new series, search for existing ones, update details, delete shows, and generate reports. It’s a good example of how you can use arrays, loops, classes, encapsulation, and unit testing in a real project.  

This project was all about building a Java program to get a better handle on key coding concepts such as handling arrays, storing data, working with JSON, and writing tests. I also used my GitHub account to push my code, displaying how professional version control and documentation practices look in real workflows.

## Features
1. Add audio comments for new TV shows, including ID, title, age restrictions, and number of episodes  
2. Find a specific season by its ID  
3. Update details about a season  
4. Delete a series  
5. Generate a full report on all series  
6. Run unit tests to ensure everything works properly

## How to Run the Program
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VCSTDN2024/prog6112-practical-assignment-Alwande-Ally.git
 2.	Open the project in NetBeans
3.	Build and run the MainApp class
4.	Follow the prompts on the console menu to navigate the program

## Menu & Navigation

The program offers these options:
1.	Add a new season
2.	Search for a series
3.	Update series age restrictions
4.	Delete a series
5.	Print a report of all series
6.	Exit the application


 ---

## GitHub Repository

All the code and related files were stored on GitHub, making it easier to track changes and keep everything organized.

It includes:
1.	Source code files
2.	A README.md file with project details and instructions
3.	A screenshot showing successful unit tests

This setup emphasizes good practices in team-based software development and code sharing.

## Unit Tests

All the unit tests for the SeriesModel class have been created and run successfully, confirming that:
1.	Searching functions correctly
2.	Updates modify the right data
3.	Deletions remove items from memory properly
4.	Age verification works as intended

## Video Demonstration

Here’s a quick video walkthrough of my work on the PROG6112 Practical Assignment, where I developed a TV Series Manager app.

In the video, I demonstrate key features like adding new series, searching through existing ones, updating details, and deleting entries. I also show how the app generates reports about the series and confirm that all unit tests pass without issues.

The video is hosted on YouTube as Unlisted, so only people with the link can view it—this keeps it private while still giving the lecturer easy access to review my work.

## Room for Improvement
	1.	Adding persistent storage, like saving data into a file or database
	2.	Making the user interface more friendly, possibly with formatting or a GUI
	3.	Incorporating more search filters, for example, by name, age, or episode count
	4.	Adding exception handling to manage invalid or unexpected inputs

## Reflection

This project helped me gain practical experience in:
1.	Working through basic Java exercises
2.	Implementing unit tests to verify my code
3.	Using GitHub for version control and documentation

These skills are essential for professional software development and will benefit me in future projects.

---

## Conclusion

Overall, I successfully finished this assignment. The program runs smoothly, all the unit tests pass, and everything is well-documented on GitHub. This project reinforced fundamental programming concepts, testing techniques, and good coding habits, all of which are important for my growth as a developer.
